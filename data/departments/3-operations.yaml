            The Operations Department ensures that member involvement
            and evaluations analyses are properly handled. It is headed by
            the Documentations and Analysis Director who closely works with the
            other departments of the organization and assesses whether those departments
            are achieving their objectives. He also maintains the organizationâ€™s files and
            assesses organizational weak spots based on departmental consultations and feedbacks.

            and the Associate Director for Member Involvement.
